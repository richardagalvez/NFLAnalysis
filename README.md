# NFL Analysis

Machine learning has had many impacts across multiple fields and industries in at least the past 10 years. In sports, statistics began playing a large role in team design and recruitment, especially after the success of the Oakland A's in the early 2000's using the methods outlined in the book and movie *Money Ball*. To read more about the use of statistics in Baseball, see [Sabremetrics in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics).

I happen to live under a rock, so I hadn't actually seen *Money Ball* until very recently on a flight-- and, wow, what an awesome movie! I was quite inspired after watching it and thought by this time probably all kinds of stats are being used to guide business and sports decisions in all major sports. I'm a huge AI and machine learning (intelligence) aficionado, and I've been a lifelong sufferer as a Miami Dolphins fan, so I decided why not check out some NFL datasets and see if one can make predictions on the success rate of certain players? Maybe the poor Dolphins could be better advised on who to draft.
